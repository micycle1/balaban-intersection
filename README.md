# ðŸš§ Line segments intersection via Balaban's algorithm.

## Overview
Reporting of segment set intersections is one of the
fundamental problems of computational geometry. This library implements *Ivan J. Balaban*'s [*Intermediate Algorithm*](https://www2.cs.sfu.ca/~binay/813.2011/Balaban.pdf) for finding intersecting segment pairs from a given set of N segments in the plane.

This algorithm has complexity *O( n\*log<sup>2</sup>(n) + k )* (where k is the number of intersecting pairs), which is **much** faster than the more commonly implemented *O( (n+k)\*log(n) )* *Bentleyâ€“Ottmann* algorithm for the same problem. 

a more uqibitous implementation for this problem. In practice therefore, this library processes segment sets 100x faster on sizable inputs compared to existing (Java) Bentleyâ€“Ottmann implementations (i.e. long segments each with many intersections). Datasets with relatively short segments see a less pronounced (though still very much considerable: perhaps 10x) performance benefit. 

This repository improves the abandoned original project from *Google Code Archive* whose author was [Taras](https://github.com/taarraas), and provides via Jitpack for Maven & Gradle for easy use in other projects.

## Algorithm

Balaban's applies the sweepline algorithm 

## Input

A single set (for self intersection), 

~~or two sets (i.e. "which edges from A intersect with edges from B?", which could be used to compute the polygonal intersection for example).~~

The algorithm itself does not check for or handle *degenerate* inputs and will error (generally a stack overflow) on such inputs. Yet the library offers a method to filter out before processing.

Segment sets are degenerate when:
- A segment is vertical (its vertices have the same y coordinate)

However you can clean the input using the 

## Usage

The algorithm does not natively compute **points** of intersection. Rather, it returns intersecting **segment pairs**. returns for O(1).

You must provide a callback function to the solver: *it* provides intersecting pairs â€” *you* decide what to do with them.
